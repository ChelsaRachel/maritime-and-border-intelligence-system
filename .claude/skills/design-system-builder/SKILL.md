# Design System Builder

Generates 4 new design system files from a user brief by replicating the **structural DNA** of the Tactical reference system — not its content — and applying quality rules.

## What This Skill Produces

Always outputs exactly **4 files** into `design/{stack}/{theme-name}/`:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `variable.css` | All design tokens as CSS custom properties (`:root` + `.dark`) |
| `tailwind.css` | `@theme inline {}` block mapping tokens → Tailwind v4 utilities |
| `DESIGN.md` | Human-readable style reference — the source of truth |
| `brand-guideline.html` | Self-contained visual guideline and widget preview for the generated theme |

---


## Guardrails

Apply these guardrails before writing tokens and again before delivery:

| Priority | Category | Must Do | Avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Accessibility | 4.5:1 body text contrast, visible focus rings, labels for icon-only controls, keyboard-safe flow | Removing focus rings, color-only meaning, unlabeled controls |
| 2 | Touch & Interaction | 44px+ targets, clear pressed/disabled/loading states, 150–300ms micro-interactions | Hover-only behavior, layout-shifting press states |
| 3 | Responsive Layout | Mobile-first breakpoints, no horizontal scroll, stable dimensions for fixed-format UI | Fixed-width containers, content hidden behind sticky bars |
| 4 | Style Fit | Match product type, audience, density, and tone; keep one coherent visual language | Mixing unrelated aesthetics or decorative effects |
| 5 | Typography & Color | 16px base body, semantic tokens, readable line-height, accessible foreground/background pairs | Raw hex in components, low-contrast gray-on-gray |
| 6 | Forms & Feedback | Visible labels, inline errors near fields, recovery path for failure, semantic disabled state | Placeholder-only labels, errors only at page top |
| 7 | Charts & Data | Accessible palettes, legends/tooltips, table fallback or text summary, responsive simplification | Relying on color alone, overloaded pie/donut charts |

Professional UI rules:
- Use SVG/icon libraries for structural icons; never use emoji as icons.
- Use one icon family, one type system, one spacing rhythm, and one elevation/radius model per theme.
- Design light and dark behavior together; verify surfaces, borders, shadows, and states in both modes.
- Every screen should have one primary action; secondary/destructive actions must be visually subordinate and spatially clear.
- Reserve space for images, charts, skeletons, and async content to avoid layout shift.

---

## Fast Mode

Activate fast mode by including `--fast` or `cepat` or `fast` anywhere in the user's prompt.

**When fast mode is ON:**
- Skip Step 1b (no `WebFetch` to extract brand colors from URL)
- Skip `WebSearch` in Step 7 (no brand history lookup)
- Use user-supplied hex as primary color directly; if no hex given, derive from brand knowledge
- Use lorem ipsum for `{{ BRAND_DESCRIPTION }}` in brand-guideline.html

**When fast mode is OFF (default):**
- Run Step 1b `WebFetch` when a URL is available
- Run `WebSearch` in Step 7 for brand profile

---

## Progress Tracking

At the **start** of every run, call `TodoWrite` to register all 8 steps before executing any of them:

```
TodoWrite([
  { id: "s1", content: "Step 1 — Parse User Brief", status: "in_progress" },
  { id: "s2", content: "Step 2 — Select Typography", status: "pending" },
  { id: "s3", content: "Step 3 — Design the Token System", status: "pending" },
  { id: "s4", content: "Step 4 — Write variable.css", status: "pending" },
  { id: "s5", content: "Step 5 — Write tailwind.css", status: "pending" },
  { id: "s6", content: "Step 6 — Write DESIGN.md", status: "pending" },
  { id: "s7", content: "Step 7 — Deploy brand-guideline.html", status: "pending" },
  { id: "s8", content: "Step 8 — Register Theme", status: "pending" }
])
```

Mark each step `completed` immediately after it finishes — before starting the next step. Never batch-complete multiple steps at once.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Parse User Brief

Extract from user input:

| Input | What to derive |
|---|---|
| App type / industry | UX density and layout approach |
| Target audience / context | Interaction density, touch target needs, reading complexity |
| UI style (glassmorphism, brutalist, minimal, etc.) | Surface treatment, radius rule, shadow rule |
| Tone (premium, playful, enterprise) | Writing voice in DESIGN.md |
| Primary / brand color | Build entire palette ramp around it |
| Dark / light / auto | Whether `.dark` block inverts or extends `:root` |
| Data intensity | Chart palette, table density, metric/card hierarchy |
| Platform expectations | Determines `{stack}` — `web` (default), `mobile`, `desktop`, etc. Web-first responsive rules; include mobile constraints for touch and small screens |

**Primary color resolution — always check user prompt first:**
1. If the user's prompt contains a hex value (e.g. `#E63946`, `e63946`, `#f00`), treat it as the primary stop-500 anchor. Strip `#`, expand 3-digit shorthands, and use it verbatim — never substitute a "nicer" shade.
2. If only a color name is given (e.g. "red", "teal"), choose an appropriate base hex that fits the brand tone.
3. **If a website URL is provided (or can be inferred from the brand name), fetch the page and extract the primary brand color** using the process below — before falling back to product type defaults.
4. If no color hint is given, derive from product type / industry defaults.

**Website color extraction (Step 1b — run when URL is available AND fast mode is OFF):**

> Skip this entire step if fast mode is active. Proceed directly to Step 2.

Use `WebFetch` to load the brand's official homepage (or the URL provided):

```
WebFetch(url, prompt="Extract all CSS color values used for primary brand elements: buttons, CTAs, active navigation, header background, links, and brand logo colors. List each as a hex value with its context (e.g. '#E63946 — primary button background'). Prioritize colors used on interactive/brand elements over generic backgrounds.")
```

Then apply this priority order to pick the primary color:
1. **CTA / primary button background** — the most reliable brand signal
2. **Active nav item or selected state**
3. **Brand logo fill color** (if not black/white)
4. **Header or hero section background** (if branded, not neutral)
5. **Link color** (if not default browser blue)

Discard: pure white (`#FFF`, `#FFFFFF`), pure black (`#000`, `#000000`), near-neutral grays (saturation < 5%), and generic browser defaults.

If multiple candidates remain, pick the most saturated non-neutral color. If the page returns no usable colors (e.g. heavily image-based, JS-only render), make a best-guess approximation by combining: (1) known brand visual identity or logo color, and (2) the tone/mood/style keywords from the user's prompt. The guess must feel coherent with both the brand and the brief — not just a generic industry default. Note that it's an approximation in DESIGN.md.

After primary is set, build the full 50–900 ramp around it and pass stop-500 to `variable.py` as `--colors primary`.

If the brief is vague, choose a conservative professional default from product type:
- Enterprise/SaaS/dashboard → dense, restrained, high-contrast, token-led.
- Consumer/creator/lifestyle → warmer surfaces, clearer affordances, more expressive brand accents.
- Data/control room/map → compact hierarchy, strong focus states, minimal decoration, high data legibility.
- Commerce/service → clear CTA hierarchy, trust cues, readable forms, strong empty/error states.

### Step 2 — Select Typography

Run the font selection script to find the best Google Font pairing for the brief:

```bash
python3 references/scripts/brand_guideline.py "<mood/style keywords from brief>" --top 3
```

Pick the top result (highest score) unless the brief explicitly names fonts. The script returns:
- `heading_font` / `body_font` — use as the primary typeface in DESIGN.md and `--font-sans` / `--font-serif` in variable.css
- `css_import` — inject as the `@import` line at the top of variable.css
- `tailwind_config` — reference when writing the `font_family` block in tailwind.css
- `notes` — use for weight scale decisions in the Typography section of DESIGN.md

### Step 3 — Design the Token System

Before writing any file, decide:

1. **Theme slug** — short kebab-case (e.g. `aurora`, `forge`, `velvet`, `obsidian`)
2. **Palette** — derive all 5 brand ramps from primary using the color harmony formula below; then add neutral + 4 state colors, each 10 stops (50–900)
3. **Typography** — use fonts from Step 2; apply weight scale from the pairing notes
4. **Surface rules** — radius policy (none / sm / md / full), shadow usage, depth model
5. **Component style** — button shape, border treatment, density level
6. **Interaction model** — hover, focus, pressed, disabled, loading, and reduced-motion behavior
7. **Accessibility model** — contrast targets, focus ring color, semantic state tokens, chart-safe pairings
8. **Responsive model** — small-phone, tablet, desktop layout rules and content priority

#### Color Harmony Formula — Secondary to Quinary

Once **primary** (stop 500) is set, derive the remaining 4 brand colors using the harmony formula that best fits the brand positioning:

| Formula | Rule | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Monokromatik** | Secondary = primary +30° sat↓, Tertiary = primary sat↓↓, Quaternary = primary lightness↑↑, Quinary = primary lightness↓ | Minimal, luxury, or highly focused single-brand products |
| **Analogus** | Secondary = primary +30°, Tertiary = primary +60°, Quaternary = primary −30°, Quinary = primary −60° (all on HSL wheel) | Lifestyle, creative, consumer apps needing warmth and visual flow |
| **Komplementer** | Secondary = primary +180°, Tertiary = midpoint between primary and secondary, Quaternary = primary +15°, Quinary = primary −15° | High-contrast enterprise, dashboards, data tools needing maximum legibility |
| **Split-Komplementer** | Secondary = primary +150°, Tertiary = primary +210°, Quaternary = primary +30°, Quinary = midpoint primary↔secondary | SaaS, productivity tools — balances variety with stability |
| **Triadik** | Secondary = primary +120°, Tertiary = primary +240°, Quaternary = primary +60°, Quinary = primary +180° | Playful, diverse consumer products, gaming, entertainment |
| **Tetradik** | Secondary = primary +90°, Tertiary = primary +180°, Quaternary = primary +270°, Quinary = midpoint primary↔tertiary | Complex dashboards, multi-category platforms needing rich color vocabulary |

**Selection logic:**

```
IF brand = luxury / minimal / focused       → Monokromatik
IF brand = lifestyle / creative / consumer  → Analogus
IF brand = enterprise / data / control room → Komplementer
IF brand = SaaS / productivity / corporate  → Split-Komplementer
IF brand = gaming / entertainment / playful → Triadik
IF brand = multi-category / complex portal  → Tetradik
```

After deriving hues, generate full 50–900 ramps for each brand color. Verify that secondary, tertiary, quaternary, and quinary stop 500 each maintain ≥ 3:1 contrast against the lightest surface token, and pass all Guardrail #1 accessibility checks before passing them to the `variable.py` script in Step 5.

#### Neutral — Derive from Primary

Do **not** use a pure gray. Tint the neutral ramp with a small amount of the primary hue to keep the palette cohesive:

| Brand tone | Neutral derivation (overall ramp) |
|---|---|
| Cool / techy / enterprise | Primary hue, saturation 4–8%, lightness 10–95% (blue-gray family) |
| Warm / lifestyle / consumer | Primary hue, saturation 4–7%, lightness 10–95% (warm-gray family) |
| Luxury / minimal | Primary hue, saturation 2–4%, lightness 5–97% (near-white to near-black) |
| Vibrant / playful | Primary hue, saturation 5–9%, lightness 15–95% (slightly tinted) |

**Dark-end saturation cap (critical for all warm hues):** For stop 900 (the darkest anchor passed to `variable.py`), saturation must **not exceed 6%** and lightness must be **6–9%** regardless of brand tone. At very low lightness, even 8–10% saturation produces a strongly visible hue cast (e.g., reddish-black instead of near-black). Use HSL to verify: `hsl(<primary-hue>, ≤4%, 4–7%)` for stop 900. Prefer 2–3% saturation when primary hue is in the red/orange range (0–40° or 320–360°). Target hex range: `#0A0909` – `#121010` for warm dark themes.

Rule: neutral stop 900 is the darkest anchor (passed as `--neutral` base to `variable.py`); the script generates lighter stops (50–800) automatically.

#### State Colors — Semantic but Brand-Aware

State colors (success, warning, error, info) are universal signals — do **not** use brand palette hues. Apply these base hues, then shift saturation/lightness to harmonize with the primary warmth/coolness:

| State | Base hue range | Adjustment |
|---|---|---|
| **Success** | Green 120–150° | Desaturate slightly for cool primaries; keep vivid for warm primaries |
| **Warning** | Amber/Yellow 35–50° | Shift warmer (40°) for cool primaries; cooler (45°) for warm primaries |
| **Error** | Red 0–15° | Shift to 5° for warm primaries; 355° (cool red) for cool primaries |
| **Info** | Blue 210–240° | Align closer to primary hue if primary is already blue-adjacent |

State colors are defined in `references/variable.yml` and **not** passed via `--colors` to `variable.py`. Only verify that:
- Each state stop 500 meets 4.5:1 against white (light mode) and dark surfaces (dark mode)
- Error is perceptually distinct from both primary and secondary at all stops
- Warning is distinguishable from success under deuteranopia simulation

### Step 4 — Write variable.css

Run the script to generate `variable.css` from the brief's color palette and fonts:

```bash
python3 references/scripts/variable.py \
  --colors '{"primary":"#HEX","secondary":"#HEX","tertiary":"#HEX","quaternary":"#HEX","quinary":"#HEX","neutral":"#HEX","success":"#HEX","warning":"#HEX","error":"#HEX","info":"#HEX"}' \
  --fonts '{"main-sans":"Font Name","main-serif":"Font Name","main-mono":"Font Name"}' \
  --output design/{stack}/{theme-name}/variable.css
```

- `--colors` — pass the hex for each color using these anchors: **brand colors** (`primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, `quaternary`, `quinary`) use stop **500** as base; **`neutral`** uses stop **900** (darkest/black) as base — the script generates lighter stops (50–800) automatically. State colors (`success`, `warning`, `error`, `info`) are read from `variable.yml` and do not need to be passed here.
- `--fonts` — pass all three font stacks from Step 2: `sans` (body), `serif` (heading), `mono` (code)
- `--output` — target path for the generated file

The script reads `references/template/variable.yml` for spacing, border-radius, border-width, shadow, and typography scale, then merges in the generated palettes and font overrides. No manual CSS editing required.

### Step 5 — Write tailwind.css

Run the script to generate `tailwind.css` from `references/template/tailwind.yml`:

```bash
python3 references/scripts/tailwind.py design/{stack}/{theme-name}/tailwind.css
```

The script reads `tailwind.yml`, maps every key group into the correct `@theme inline {}` CSS variable declarations, and writes the output file. No manual editing required.

### Step 6 — Write DESIGN.md

Before running the script, compose all creative decisions from Steps 1–3 into the full input JSON. The script renders a complete DESIGN.md in one pass — **no post-editing required**.

```bash
python3 references/scripts/design_md.py \
  --input '{

    "theme_mode":    "{light|dark|system}",

  }' \
  --output design/{stack}/{theme-name}/DESIGN.md
```

The script fills every slot and outputs a complete, final DESIGN.md. No post-editing of the output file is required.

### Step 7 — Deploy brand-guideline.html

Run the script to copy the template and inject the selected Google Font:

```bash
python3 references/scripts/brand_guideline.py "<same query from Step 2>" \
  --deploy-html design/web/{theme-name} \
  --name "{Human-Readable Design System Name}"
```

The script copies `references/template/brand-guideline.html` into the theme folder and replaces:
- `{{FONT_FAMILY}}` — with the correct Google Fonts stylesheet URL
- `{{ DESIGN_SYSTEM_NAME }}` — with the value passed via `--name` (falls back to the theme folder name if omitted)
- `{{ BRAND_TAGLINE }}` — short one-line descriptor of the design system's purpose/positioning (e.g. `Enterprise banking design language`, `Premium fintech dashboard foundation`). Derive from the product brief; if not clear, use `{Product type} design system`.

After the script runs, replace the two brand logo placeholders in the output HTML:

**Finding the official domain:**
1. If the user's prompt contains a URL — extract the domain from it directly.
2. Otherwise, identify the brand's official domain from what you know (e.g. `manutd.com`, `bsi.co.id`). If unsure, do a quick search.

**Brand description for `{{ BRAND_DESCRIPTION }}`:**

- If the user's prompt includes a brand description → use it directly.
- If fast mode is **ON** → use lorem ipsum (no search).
- If fast mode is **OFF** and no description in prompt → run WebSearch:

```
WebSearch("{brand name} company profile about history")
```

Extract: founding year, core business, brand positioning. Write 2–3 sentences, neutral professional tone. If WebSearch returns no useful results, fall back to lorem ipsum — do not block or ask the user.

**`{{ BRAND_FAVICON_URL }}`** — always use Google's favicon service:
```
https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain={official-domain}&sz=128
```
Example: `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=manutd.com&sz=128`

- `{{ BRAND_ABBR }}` — short uppercase abbreviation of the brand name used as fallback text (e.g. `BSI`, `PLN`, `BRI`, `MUFC`). Use 2–4 characters max.
- `{{ BRAND_SLUG }}` — lowercase kebab-case identifier used for localStorage keys (e.g. `manutd`, `bsi`, `pln`). Derive from the theme slug.
- `{{ BRAND_DESCRIPTION }}` — 2–3 sentence brand history or product context paragraph. Derive from WebSearch results or known brand facts. Falls back to lorem ipsum if brand is unknown or search returns no useful results.
**Naming brand colors — rules (apply before filling any `{{ COLOR_*_NAME }}`):**

Color names must always reflect the **actual hue** of the color, not a generic slot label. Follow this process:

1. Look at the actual hex value for each brand color from Step 3.
2. Identify the hue family: red / orange / amber / yellow / lime / green / teal / cyan / blue / indigo / violet / purple / pink / rose / neutral.
3. Combine hue with a brand-relevant word — draw from the brand's domain, geography, culture, or values.
4. Cross-check: the name must be immediately recognizable as that color. If someone reads "Biru Kepercayaan" they must expect a blue — never orange.

| Hue family | Example brand words to combine |
|---|---|
| Teal / Cyan / Green | Islami, Hijau, Nusantara, Sejuk, Subur |
| Purple / Violet | Syariah, Digital, Langit, Mulia |
| Orange / Amber | Emas, Hangat, Nusantara, Bara, Senja |
| Blue | Kepercayaan, Laut, Langit, Samudera |
| Red / Rose | Berani, Merah, Garuda, Semangat |

Apply the same logic for international brands — draw from club nicknames, team colors, geography, or product identity.

- `{{ COLOR_PRIMARY_NAME }}` — memorable name for the primary color. **Must reflect the actual hue** (e.g. `Hijau Islami` for teal, `Manchester Red` for red). Never use a generic label like "Primary Color".
- `{{ COLOR_SECONDARY_NAME }}` — memorable name for the secondary color. Must match secondary hex hue.
- `{{ COLOR_TERTIARY_NAME }}` — memorable name for the tertiary color. Must match tertiary hex hue.
- `{{ COLOR_QUATERNARY_NAME }}` — memorable name for the quaternary color. Must match quaternary hex hue.
- `{{ COLOR_QUINARY_NAME }}` — memorable name for the quinary color. Must match quinary hex hue.
- `{{ COLOR_HARMONY_TYPE }}` — name of the harmony formula used (e.g. `Analogous + Split-Complementary`, `Triadic`). From Step 3 selection.
- `{{ COLOR_HARMONY_SHORT }}` — one-line summary of the palette relationship (e.g. `warm triad balanced by two cool accents`).
- `{{ COLOR_HARMONY_REASON }}` — 1–2 sentence rationale explaining why this harmony fits the brand identity and avoids visual conflict.

No manual HTML editing required for fonts.

### Step 8 — Register Theme

Update design/design-system.md every time a new design system is created.

Rules:
- Only ONE design system can have active status.
- All previous design systems MUST automatically change to inactive.
- The newly added design system becomes the ONLY active theme.
- Never allow multiple active themes simultaneously.

If design-system.md does not exist:
- create the file first
- create the header table structure

Required table structure:

```md
| platform | theme | path | status |
|----------|-------|------|--------|
```

---

## Output Path

`{stack}` is derived from the platform in Step 1. Default: `web`. Other valid values: `mobile`, `desktop`, etc.

```
design/{stack}/{theme-name}/
├── DESIGN.md
├── variable.css
├── tailwind.css
└── brand-guideline.html
```
